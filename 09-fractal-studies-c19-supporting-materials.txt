Supporting Materials

Extensions and components developed as part of the process in creating Fractal Studies in the Age of COVID-19 that support data collection, observations and analysis.

Omeka Archive
Image and data archives of photo-documented observations built with Omeka.net. 
Using Omeka.net as a tool to create an image and metadata archive for this project allowed me to learn and experiment with a Digital Humanities tool I was previously unfamiliar with. Omeka.net’s DH roots, ethics, and use of Dublin Core to standardize metadata were what drove me to choose this tool. 

StoryMap
Exploring data collected for Report #6: Documenting Impact as published in StoryMap. 
When considering visualization tools for critically enhancing this project, I ultimately chose to explore StoryMap because of its storytelling device of framing and transition which helped create a stronger analogy between the digital and analog visual narratives.

Analog Visualizations
Critically enhancing Report #6: Documenting Impact with analog visualizations.
These analog readings prioritize the human of digital humanities both in their truer articulation of my observation and analysis and in the subject matter of the drawings themselves. Working pen-to-paper influenced a more creative and applicable digital visual narrative and played an essential role in advancing critical reflection and analysis.
