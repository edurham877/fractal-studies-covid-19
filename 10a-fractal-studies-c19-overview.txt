Overview

Fractal Studies in the Age of COVID-19 is an effort to create a space to build upon an iterative exploration of Digital Humanities practices in publication development while centering the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on my self and home at a small scale and the neighborhood I live in at a larger scale. I aim to observe and identify recursive patterns that exist in both the observed settings and in the scaling modular process this project follows. Ultimately, contributing to a collective documentation of experiences and critical examinations of our individual and shares conditions in the context of this historic moment.
