Observation Exercise #4: Photo Documentation

I found the process of observation and critique in Report #1 inherently feeding a “process of making” that Hunter et al makes point of in “Reifying the Maker as Humanist.” In this exercise, I found I was becoming more interested in the visual observations I was making while walking around and decided to take photo documentation for further reference. Fig. 4 is an obscured collage of the photos I took in observation to serve as evidence of this observation exercise rather than images and data as part of this report and larger publication.
