Observation Exercise #1: Written Reflection

I found the process of observation and critique in Report #1 inherently feeding a “process of making” that Hunter et al makes point of in “Reifying the Maker as Humanist.” My initial impulse for observation resulted in this exercise which was to take notes on a digital document. However, I noticed the bullet and table format was inherently structuring and my observation.

Extracted text from the chart depicted in fig. 1:
Myself 
	• Focus: increased difficulty reading, forgetfulness
	• Warped sense of time
	• Anxiety: more second guessing, indecision, increased concern of protecting others
	• Preference to stay home
	• Eating more nutritiously with full access to a kitchen
	• Communication with others:
		◦ Inefficiencies in short-form text communication.
		◦ However, more reflection/response time sometimes leads to more effective/intentional communicating
	• Zoom fatigue/screen fatigue
	• Social connection
		◦ Disrupted at large
		◦ But proximity and circumstance has fostered more connection with son
	• New mapping routines: body scans, temp taking, tracking use of essential items, etc.
	• Wellness: sleep disruption, more reliance on remedies, less access to in-person healing
	• Pastimes shifts: sitting outside and observing, weeding, ‘dread scrolling’, podcasts, nesting, home improvements

Even the way I amapproaching this class, notbeing in a physicalclassroom, not having amore conversationalenvironmentIt challenges my thoughtthat I had been adjusting toremote formats based onmy last class and work.Being more homeboundhas inherently made memore observant. Overallincrease in observation.

Home 
	• Pets: dog is less anxious, cats more distant
	• Transitional/temporary spaces and setups and upheaval
	• Food stores
	• More clutter/disarray, cleaning tools often never put away
	• Additional use of electricity, water
	• Extra recyclables due to packages, inability to use reusable bags
The home is being used inways it was neverintended, and much moreextensively.Higher reliance on utilitiesand more wear onappliances.
Either/Both 
	• Documentation: to-do lists, charts, extra calendars
	• Increased home improvement
	• Different use of home: more use of kitchen, bathroom, garden/yard/patio, less use of living room
	• Increase internet data usage
	• Products: hand sanitizer, hand soap, masks, “go bags” with PPE for leaving the house

Without hosting others, we’ve been able to movethings around and experiment to make thingsmore functional for us.Housetending, nesting,home improvements have become a pastime butthere is also often anephemeral or unsettled feeling.
