Observation Exercise #2: Motion Map

I found the process of observation and critique in Report #1 inherently feeding a “process of making” that Hunter et al makes point of in “Reifying the Maker as Humanist.” In this exercise, I tracked the locations of the inhabitants of my home on the half-hour and mapped our paths of movement throughout the day.
