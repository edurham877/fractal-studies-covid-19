Divergent Exploration #2: Basic Text Analysis

Exploring text analysis tools in the context of digital humanities scholarship. In this, I take a detour for surface level experiment with Voyant in consideration of the framework of this larger project.
The corpus I used for analysis was the City of Lincoln Mayoral Media Releases RSS feed. Fig. 1 shows a screen capture of a TermsBerry that is generated and ‘covid’ selected as the keyword. This is a very basic analysis and skewed results must be recognized since there was not any intentional clean up or curation of the corpus prior.
